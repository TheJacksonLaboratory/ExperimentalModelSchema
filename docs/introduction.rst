Introduction to the Experimental Model Schema
#############################################

Model organisms offer the opportunity to perform system-level investigations
of the effects of genetic variants, environmental exposures, or candidate
therapeutic strategies on physiological and pathophysiological -omics
networks in multiple tissues in a way that would be impossible in
human studies (`Lloyd et al., 2016 <https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf5474>`_).
Deep modeling of model organism resources, for many of which multi-omics
and experimental interventional data are available will allow us to simultaneously model phenotypic, variation, and genomic functional (RNA-seq, scRNA, ATAC-seq, etc.) data.

The main goal of the Experimental Model Schema is to create a semantic
framework for modeling the experimental data (genetics, genomics, experimental
paramenters, phenotypic features, measurements) for experiments on model
organisms in a way that will be compatible with the
Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)
